 abstract = {The solvation energy and entropy at infinite dilution consist of a solute-solvent term and a solvent reorganization term representing the contributions of changes in solvent structure upon solute insertion. In the standard, homogeneous treatment of solutions, changes in solvent structure are expressed through derivatives of the homogeneous pair correlation function, which are very difficult to obtain by simulation. Tractable expressions for the solvation energy and entropy are here derived by viewing the solution as an inhomogeneous system with the solute fixed at a certain point. The solvent reorganization terms in the inhomogeneous view contain two contributions: the local, ''correlation'' contributions, which are due to correlations between the solute and the solvent and dominate at high densities, and the nonlocal, ''liberation'' contributions, which are due to the effective dilution of the solvent caused by the thermal motion of the solute and dominate at low densities. The liberation contributions are independent of the nature or size of the solute and depend only on the properties of the solvent. For common liquid solvents the nonlocal terms are negligible and the solvation properties arise almost entirely from effects localized around the solute. The new expressions are tested by calculations of the solvent reorganization energy and entropy in ideal hard-sphere and Lennard-Jones mixtures (solute identical to solvent). The solvent reorganization energy and entropy make distinct and significant contributions to the solvation free energy. The theory can be applied to truly inhomogeneous systems as well as small solute solvation, thus:providing a connection between interfacial phenomena and microscopic solvation.},

 abstract = {The displacement of perturbed water upon binding is believed to play a critical role in the thermodynamics of biomolecular recognition, but it is nontrivial to unambiguously define and answer questions about this process. We address this issue by introducing grid inhomogeneous solvation theory (GIST), which discretizes the equations of inhomogeneous solvation theory (IST) onto a three-dimensional grid situated in the region of interest around a solute molecule or complex. Snapshots from explicit solvent simulations are used to estimate localized solvation entropies, energies, and free energies associated with the grid boxes, or voxels, and properly summing these thermodynamic quantities over voxels yields information about hydration thermodynamics. GIST thus provides a smoothly varying representation of water properties as a function of position, rather than focusing on hydration sites where solvent is present at high density. It therefore accounts for full or partial displacement of water from sites that are highly occupied by water, as well as for partly occupied and water-depleted regions around the solute. GIST can also provide a well-defined estimate of the solvation free energy and therefore enables a rigorous end-states analysis of binding. For example, one may not only use a first GIST calculation to project the thermodynamic consequences of displacing water from the surface of a receptor by a ligand, but also account, in a second GIST calculation, for the thermodynamics of subsequent solvent reorganization around the bound complex. In the present study, a first GIST analysis of the molecular host cucurbit[7]uril is found to yield a rich picture of hydration structure and thermodynamics in and around this miniature receptor. One of the most striking results is the observation of a toroidal region of high water density at the center of the host's nonpolar cavity. Despite its high density, the water in this toroidal region is disfavored energetically and entropically, and hence may contribute to the known ability of this small receptor to bind guest molecules with unusually high affinities. Interestingly, the toroidal region of high water density persists even when all partial charges of the receptor are set to zero. Thus, localized regions of high solvent density can be generated in a binding site without strong, attractive solute-solvent interactions. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

GIST is a grid-based implementation of Inhomogeneous Fluid Solvation Theory, which analyzes the output from molecular dynamics simulations to map out solvation thermodynamic and structural properties on a high-resolution, three-dimensional grid. The CPPTRAJ implementation, called GIST-cpptraj, has a simple, easy-to-use command line interface, and is open source and freely distributed. We have also developed a set of open-source tools, called GISTPP, which facilitate the analysis of GIST output grids. Tutorials for both GIST-cpptraj and GISTPP can be found at ambermd.org.

 abstract = {Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory (GIST) maps out solvation thermodynamic properties on a fine meshed grid and provides a statistical mechanical formalism for thermodynamic end-state calculations. However, differences in how long-range nonbonded interactions are calculated in molecular dynamics engines and in the current implementation of GIST have prevented precise comparisons between free energies estimated using GIST and those from other free energy methods such as thermodynamic integration (TI). Here, we address this by presenting PME-GIST, a formalism by which particle mesh Ewald (PME)-based electrostatic energies and long-range Lennard-Jones (LJ) energies are decomposed and assigned to individual atoms and the corresponding voxels they occupy in a manner consistent with the GIST approach. PME-GIST yields potential energy calculations that are precisely consistent with modern simulation engines and performs these calculations at a dramatically faster speed than prior implementations. Here, we apply PME-GIST end-state analyses to 32 small molecules whose solvation free energies are close to evenly distributed from 2 kcal/mol to -17 kcal/mol and obtain solvation energies consistent with TI calculations (R(2) = 0.99, mean unsigned difference 0.8 kcal/mol). We also estimate the entropy contribution from the second and higher order entropy terms that are truncated in GIST by the differences between entropies calculated in TI and GIST. With a simple correction for the high order entropy terms, PME-GIST obtains solvation free energies that are highly consistent with TI calculations (R(2) = 0.99, mean unsigned difference = 0.4 kcal/mol) and experimental results (R(2) = 0.88, mean unsigned difference = 1.4 kcal/mol). The precision of PME-GIST also enables us to show that the solvation free energy of small hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules can be largely understood based on perturbations of the solvent in a region extending a few solvation shells from the solute. We have integrated PME-GIST into the open-source molecular dynamics analysis software CPPTRAJ.},

 abstract = {The relation of surface polarity and conformational preferences is decisive for cell permeability and thus bioavailability of macrocyclic drugs. Here, we employ grid inhomogeneous solvation theory (GIST) to calculate solvation free energies for a series of six macrocycles in water and chloroform as a measure of passive membrane permeability. We perform accelerated molecular dynamics simulations to capture a diverse structural ensemble in water and chloroform, allowing for a direct profiling of solvent-dependent conformational preferences. Subsequent GIST calculations facilitate a quantitative measure of solvent preference in the form of a transfer free energy, calculated from the ensemblea-veraged solvation free energies in water and chloroform. Hence, the proposed method considers how the conformational diversity of macrocycles in polar and apolar solvents translates into transfer free energies. Following this strategy, we find a striking correlation of 0.92 between experimentally determined cell permeabilities and calculated transfer free energies. For the studied model systems, we find that the transfer free energy exceeds the purely water- based solvation free energies as a reliable estimate of cell permeability and that conformational sampling is imperative for a physically meaningful model. We thus recommend this purely physics-based approach as a computational tool to assess cell permeabilities of macrocyclic drug candidates.},

 abstract = {Reliable information on partition coefficients plays a key role in drug development, as solubility decisively affects bioavailability. In a physicochemical context, the partition coefficient of a solute between two different solvents can be described as a function of solvation free energies. Hence, substantial scientific efforts have been made toward accurate predictions of solvation free energies in various solvents. The grid inhomogeneous solvation theory (GIST) facilitates the calculation of solvation free energies. In this study, we introduce an extended version of the GIST algorithm, which enables the calculation for chloroform in addition to water. Furthermore, GIST allows localization of enthalpic and entropic contributions. We test our approach by calculating partition coefficients between water and chloroform for a set of eight small molecules. We report a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 between experimentally determined and calculated partition coefficients. The capability to reliably predict partition coefficients between water and chloroform and the possibility to localize their contributions allow the optimization of a compound's partition coefficient. Therefore, we presume that this methodology will be of great benefit for the efficient development of pharmaceuticals.},

abstract = {Abstract We have compared the predictions of ligand-binding affinities from several methods based on end-point molecular dynamics simulations and continuum solvation, that is, methods related to MM/PBSA (molecular mechanics combined with Poisson–Boltzmann and surface area solvation). Two continuum-solvation models were considered, viz., the Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) and generalised Born (GB) approaches. The nonelectrostatic energies were also obtained in two different ways, viz., either from the sum of the bonded, van der Waals, nonpolar solvation energies, and entropy terms (as in MM/PBSA), or from the scaled protein–ligand van der Waals interaction energy (as in the linear interaction energy approach, LIE). Three different approaches to calculate electrostatic energies were tested, viz., the sum of electrostatic interaction energies and polar solvation energies, obtained either from a single simulation of the complex or from three independent simulations of the complex, the free protein, and the free ligand, or the linear-response approximation (LRA). Moreover, we investigated the effect of scaling the electrostatic interactions by an effective internal dielectric constant of the protein (ϵint). All these methods were tested on the binding of seven biotin analogues to avidin and nine 3-amidinobenzyl-1H-indole-2-carboxamide inhibitors to factor Xa. For avidin, the best results were obtained with a combination of the LIE nonelectrostatic energies with the MM+GB electrostatic energies from a single simulation, using ϵint = 4. For fXa, standard MM/GBSA, based on one simulation and using ϵint = 4–10 gave the best result. The optimum internal dielectric constant seems to be slightly higher with PB than with GB solvation. © Proteins 2012; © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

 abstract = {The thermodynamic and structural cooperativity between the Ser45- and D128-biotin hydrogen bonds was measured by calorimetric and X-ray crystallographic studies of the S45A/D128A double mutant of streptavidin. The double mutant exhibits a binding affinity similar to 2 x 107 times lower than that of wild-type streptavidin at 25 degrees C. The corresponding reduction in binding free energy (Delta Delta G) of 10.1 kcal/mol was nearly completely due to binding enthalpy losses at this temperature. The loss of binding affinity is 11-fold greater than that predicted by a linear combination of the single-mutant energetic perturbations (8.7 kcal/mol), indicating that these two mutations interact cooperatively. Crystallographic characterization of the double mutant and comparison with the two single mutant structures suggest that structural rearrangements at the S45 position, when the D128 carboxylate is removed, mask the true energetic contribution of the D128-biotin interaction. Taken together, the thermodynamic and structural analyses support the conclusion that the wild-type hydrogen bond between D128-OD and biotin-N2 is thermodynamically stronger than that between S45-OG and biotin N1.},

 abstract = {An entropically-driven binding interaction at a certain temperature may change to an enthalpically-driven process at another temperature, depending on the polarization state of the groups that are involved in binding. The streptavidin-biotin complex has been extensively studied across biological, medical, chemical and material science fields using various techniques, however, not much has been reported on this interaction across a broad temperature range, between 2 degrees C and 40 degrees C using biophysical techniques. In this study, we determined how the forces involved in the streptavidin-biotin complex formation are affected by the reaction temperature using the Affinity ITC (TA Instruments). We observed that this complex formation is a spontaneous binding process, indicated by a negative Gibbs energy (Delta G) at all temperatures tested. The observed negative heat capacity (Delta C-p) similar to -459.9 cal/mol K highlights the polar solvation of the interaction that corresponds to a decreasing enthalpy (more negative) (Delta H) with increasing reaction temperature. The stoichiometry (n) of 0.98 was estimated at 25 degrees C. An increase in reaction temperature resulted in an almost two-fold increase or more in n, notably from 1.59 to 3.41 between 30 degrees C and 40 degrees C. Whereas, at lower reaction temperatures, 2 degrees C to 10 degrees C, higher molar binding ratios were recorded, i.e. 2.74 to 5.76. We report an enthalpically-driven interaction between 30 degrees C and 40 degrees C whereas, an entropically-favourable interaction is observed at lower temperatures, suggestive of an interaction dominated by nonpolar interactions at lower temperatures and polar interactions at higher temperatures. Consequently, alterations in the polarisation state of streptavidin result in moderate binding affinity of biotin to streptavidin at higher reaction temperatures, K-D 10(-4) \ensuremath{<}= 10(-5) M.},

 abstract = {Deep learning is revolutionizing many areas of science and technology, especially image, text, and speech recognition. In this paper, we demonstrate how a deep neural network (NN) trained on quantum mechanical (QM) DFT calculations can learn an accurate and transferable potential for organic molecules. We introduce ANAKIN-ME (Accurate NeurAl networK engINe for Molecular Energies) or ANI for short. ANI is a new method designed with the intent of developing transferable neural network potentials that utilize a highly-modified version of the Behler and Parrinello symmetry functions to build single-atom atomic environment vectors (AEV) as a molecular representation. AEVs provide the ability to train neural networks to data that spans both configurational and conformational space, a feat not previously accomplished on this scale. We utilized ANI to build a potential called ANI-1, which was trained on a subset of the GDB databases with up to 8 heavy atoms in order to predict total energies for organic molecules containing four atom types: H, C, N, and O. To obtain an accelerated but physically relevant sampling of molecular potential surfaces, we also proposed a Normal Mode Sampling (NMS) method for generating molecular conformations. Through a series of case studies, we show that ANI-1 is chemically accurate compared to reference DFT calculations on much larger molecular systems (up to 54 atoms) than those included in the training data set.},

An overview of techniques to determine entropy differences is given, and the accuracy and convergence behavior of five methods based on thermodynamic integration and perturbation techniques was evaluated using liquid water as a test system. Reasonably accurate entropy differences are obtained through thermodynamic integration in which many copies of a solute are desolvated. When only one solute molecule is involved, only two methods seem to yield useful results, the calculation of solute-solvent entropy through thermodynamic integration, and the calculation of solvation entropy through the temperature derivative of the corresponding free-energy difference.

Herein we address this issue by generating the relevant configurational states of a protein flap on the molecular energy landscape using an approach we call MTFlex-b and then following this with a procedure to estimate the free energy associated with the motion of the flap region. To illustrate our overall workflow, we explored the free energy changes in the streptavidin/biotin system upon introducing conformational flexibility in loop3{\textendash}4 in the biotin unbound (apo) and bound (holo) state. The free energy surfaces were created using the Movable Type free energy method, and for further validation, we compared them to potential of mean force (PMF) generated free energy surfaces using MD simulations employing the FF99SBILDN and FF14SB force fields. We also estimated the free energy thermodynamic cycle using an ensemble of closed-like and open-like end states for the ligand unbound and bound states and estimated the binding free energy to be approximately -16.2 kcal/mol (experimental -18.3 kcal/mol). The good agreement between MTFlex-b in combination with the MT method with experiment and MD simulations supports the effectiveness of our strategy in obtaining unique insights into the motions in proteins that can then be used in a range of biological and biomedical applications.},

 title = {Grid inhomogeneous solvation theory for cross-solvation in rigid solvents},
 abstract = {Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory (GIST) has proven useful to calculate localized thermodynamic properties of water around a solute. Numerous studies have leveraged this information to enhance structure-based binding predictions. We have recently extended GIST toward chloroform as a solvent to allow the prediction of passive membrane permeability. Here, we further generalize the GIST algorithm toward all solvents that can be modeled as rigid molecules. This restriction is inherent to the method and is already present in the inhomogeneous solvation theory. Here, we show that our approach can be applied to various solvent molecules by comparing the results of GIST simulations with thermodynamic integration (TI) calculations and experimental results. Additionally, we analyze and compare a matrix consisting of 100 entries of ten different solvent molecules solvated within each other. We find that the GIST results are highly correlated with TI calculations as well as experiments. For some solvents, we find Pearson correlations of up to 0.99 to the true entropy, while others are affected by the first-order approximation more strongly. The enthalpy-entropy splitting provided by GIST allows us to extend a recently published approach, which estimates higher order entropies by a linear scaling of the first-order entropy, to solvents other than water. Furthermore, we investigate the convergence of GIST in different solvents. We conclude that our extension to GIST reliably calculates localized thermodynamic properties for different solvents and thereby significantly extends the applicability of this widely used method.},

These methods make use of summations of ring and chain cluster diagrams. The summations are performed explicitly for certain classes of molecular models. The molecules in these classes contain several {\textquotedblleft}interaction sites{\textquotedblright}, and the total interaction between two molecules is a sum of site-site potentials that depend on the scalar distances between sites on the two molecules. The principal results of this work are computationally simple techniques for calculating the thermo-dynamic properties and pair correlation functions of molecular fluids in which the intermolecular interactions are highly angular dependent. The techniques should be reliable since they arise from the same approximations that have been shown to be very accurate when applied to simple fluids.},

 title = {Role of the Active-Site Solvent in the Thermodynamics of Factor Xa Ligand Binding},
 abstract = {Understanding the underlying physics of the binding of small-molecule ligands to protein active sites is a key objective of computational chemistry and biology. It is widely believed that displacement of water molecules from the active site by the ligand is a principal (if not the dominant) source of binding free energy. Although continuum theories of hydration are routinely used to describe the contributions of the solvent to the binding affinity of the complex, it is still an unsettled question as to whether or not these continuum solvation theories describe the underlying molecular physics with sufficient accuracy to reliably rank the binding affinities of a set of ligands for a given protein. Here we develop a novel, computationally efficient descriptor of the contribution of the solvent to the binding free energy of a small molecule and its associated receptor that captures the effects of the ligand displacing the solvent from the protein active site with atomic detail. This descriptor quantitatively predicts (R(2) = 0.81) the binding free energy differences between congeneric ligand pairs for the test system factor Xa, elucidates physical properties of the active-site solvent that appear to be missing in most continuum theories of hydration, and identifies several features of the hydration of the factor Xa active site relevant to the structure-activity relationship of its inhibitors.},

The package also extends the applicability of solvation analysis calculations to multiple molecular dynamics (MD) simulation programs by using existing cross-platform tools for parsing MD parameter and trajectory files. SSTMap is implemented in Python and contains both command-line tools and a Python module to facilitate flexibility in setting up calculations and for automated generation of large data sets involving analysis of multiple solutes. Output is generated in formats compatible with popular Python data science packages. This tool will be used by the molecular modeling community for computational analysis of water in problems of biophysical interest such as ligand binding and protein function.},

 title = {Explicit solvation thermodynamics in ionic solution: {Extending} grid inhomogeneous solvation theory to solvation free energy of salt{\textendash}water mixtures},
 journal = {J Comput Aided Mol Des},
 abstract = {Hydration thermodynamics play a fundamental role in fields ranging from the pharmaceutical industry to environmental research. Numerous methods exist to predict solvation thermodynamics of compounds ranging from small molecules to large biomolecules. Arguably the most precise methods are those based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit solvent. One theory that has seen increased use is inhomogeneous solvation theory (IST). However, while many applications require accurate description of salt-water mixtures, no implementation of IST is currently able to estimate solvation properties involving more than one solvent species. Here, we present an extension to grid inhomogeneous solvation theory (GIST) that can take salt contributions into account. At the example of carbazole in 1 M NaCl solution, we compute the solvation energy as well as first and second order entropies. While the effect of the first order ion entropy is small, both the water-water and water-ion entropies contribute strongly. We show that the water-ion entropies are efficiently approximated using the Kirkwood superposition approximation. However, this approach cannot be applied to the water-water entropy. Furthermore, we test the quantitative validity of our method by computing salting-out coefficients and comparing them to experimental data. We find a good correlation to experimental salting-out constants, while the absolute values are overpredicted due to the approximate second order entropy. Since ions are frequently used in MD, either to neutralize the system or as a part of the investigated process, our method greatly extends the applicability of GIST.

 title = {Spatial Decomposition of Translational {Water{\textendash}Water} Correlation Entropy in Binding Pockets},
 abstract = {A number of computational tools available today compute the thermodynamic properties of water at surfaces and in binding pockets by using inhomogeneous solvation theory (IST) to analyze explicit-solvent simulations. Such methods enable qualitative spatial mappings of both energy and entropy around a solute of interest and can also be applied quantitatively. However, the entropy estimates of existing methods have, to date, been almost entirely limited to the first-order terms in the IST's entropy expansion. These first-order terms account for localization and orientation of water molecules in the field of the solute but not for the modification of water-water correlations by the solute. Here, we present an extension of the Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory (GIST) approach which accounts for water-water translational correlations. The method involves rewriting the two-point density of water in terms of a conditional density and utilizes the efficient nearest-neighbor entropy estimation approach. Spatial maps of this second order term, for water in and around the synthetic host cucurbit[7]uril and in the binding pocket of the enzyme Factor Xa, reveal mainly negative contributions, indicating solute-induced water-water correlations relative to bulk water; particularly strong signals are obtained for sites at the entrances of cavities or pockets. This second-order term thus enters with the same, negative, sign as the first order translational and orientational terms. Numerical and convergence properties of the methodology are examined.},

 title = {The {MM/PBSA} and {MM/GBSA} methods to estimate ligand-binding affinities},
 abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The molecular mechanics energies combined with the Poisson-Boltzmann or generalized Born and surface area continuum solvation (MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA) methods are popular approaches to estimate the free energy of the binding of small ligands to biological macromolecules. They are typically based on molecular dynamics simulations of the receptor-ligand complex and are therefore intermediate in both accuracy and computational effort between empirical scoring and strict alchemical perturbation methods. They have been applied to a large number of systems with varying success. AREAS COVERED: The authors review the use of MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA methods to calculate ligand-binding affinities, with an emphasis on calibration, testing and validation, as well as attempts to improve the methods, rather than on specific applications. EXPERT OPINION: MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA are attractive approaches owing to their modular nature and that they do not require calculations on a training set. They have been used successfully to reproduce and rationalize experimental findings and to improve the results of virtual screening and docking. However, they contain several crude and questionable approximations, for example, the lack of conformational entropy and information about the number and free energy of water molecules in the binding site. Moreover, there are many variants of the method and their performance varies strongly with the tested system. Likewise, most attempts to ameliorate the methods with more accurate approaches, for example, quantum-mechanical calculations, polarizable force fields or improved solvation have deteriorated the results.},

 title = {Hybrid {QSPR} models for the prediction of the free energy of solvation of organic solute/solvent pairs},
 abstract = {Due to the importance of the Gibbs free energy of solvation in understanding many physicochemical phenomena, including lipophilicity, phase equilibria and liquid-phase reaction equilibrium and kinetics, there is a need for predictive models that can be applied across large sets of solvents and solutes. In this paper, we propose two quantitative structure property relationships (QSPRs) to predict the Gibbs free energy of solvation, developed using partial least squares (PLS) and multivariate linear regression (MLR) methods for 295 solutes in 210 solvents with total number of data points of 1777. Unlike other QSPR models, the proposed models are not restricted to a specific solvent or solute. Furthermore, while most QSPR models include either experimental or quantum mechanical descriptors, the proposed models combine both, using experimental descriptors to represent the solvent and quantum mechanical descriptors to represent the solute. Up to twelve experimental descriptors and nine quantum mechanical descriptors are considered in the proposed models. Extensive internal and external validation is undertaken to assess model accuracy in predicting the Gibbs free energy of solvation for a large number of solute/solvent pairs. The best MLR model, which includes three solute descriptors and two solvent properties, yields a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.88 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.59 kcal mol-1 for the training set. The best PLS model includes six latent variables, and has an R2 value of 0.91 and a RMSE of 0.52 kcal mol-1. The proposed models are compared to selected results based on continuum solvation quantum chemistry calculations. They enable the fast prediction of the Gibbs free energy of solvation of a wide range of solutes in different solvents.},

The real spread and success of this expectation will be strictly linked to different factors, among which a fundamental one will be the capacity of simulations of (supra)molecular systems to include environment effects. It is in fact well-known that molecular responses and processes are strongly affected or, in some cases, completely determined by the surrounding environment (either a solvent, a protein, a membrane, a polymer, or a composite matrix). This Perspective highlights recent achievements and suggests possible future developments of one of the most popular approaches to include environmental effects in molecular calculations, the continuun solvation model.},

 abstract = {By utilizing Graphics Processing Units, we show that constant pH molecular dynamics simulations (CpHMD) run in Generalized Born (GB) implicit solvent for long time scales can yield poor plc predictions as a result of sampling unrealistic conformations. To address this shortcoming, we present a method for performing constant pH molecular dynamics simulations (CpHMD) in explicit solvent using a discrete protonation state model. The method involves standard molecular dynamics (MD) being propagated in explicit solvent followed by protonation state changes being attempted in GB implicit solvent at fixed intervals. Replica exchange along the pH-dimension (pH-REMD) helps to obtain acceptable titration behavior with the proposed method. We analyzed the effects of various parameters and settings on the CpH\_MD and pH-REMD in explicit solvent, including the size of the simulation unit cell and the length of the relaxation dynamics following protonation state changes. We tested the method with the amino acid model compounds, a small pentapeptide with two titratable sites, and hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL). The proposed method yields superior predicted pK(a) values for HEWL over hundreds of nanoseconds of simulation relative to corresponding predicted values from simulations run in implicit solvent.},

Solubility in general is extremely important, both for theoretical reasons it provides an important probe of the balance between solute solute and solute solvent interactions and for more practical reasons, such as how to control the solubility of a given solute via modulation of its environment, as in process chemistry and separations. Here, we study how the change of solvent affects the solubility of a given compound. That is, we calculate relative solubilities. We use MD simulations to calculate relative solubility and compare our calculated values with experiment as well as with results from several other methods, SMD and UNIFAC, the latter of which is commonly used in chemical engineering design. We find that straightforward solubility calculations based on molecular simulations using a general small-molecule force field outperform SMD and UNIFAC both in terms of accuracy and coverage of the relevant chemical space.},

First, the inverse temperature phenomenology of hydrophobic interactions, i.e., strengthening of hydrophobic bonds with increasing temperature, is decisively exhibited by hydrophobic interactions between atomic-scale hard sphere solutes in water. Second, inclusion of attractive interactions associated with atomic-size hydrophobic reference cases leads to substantial, nontrivial corrections to reference results for purely repulsive solutes. Hydrophobic bonds are weakened by adding solute dispersion forces to treatment of reference cases. The classic statistical mechanical theory for those corrections is not accurate in this application, but molecular quasi-chemical theory shows promise. Finally, because of the masking roles of excluded volume and attractive interactions, comparisons that do not discriminate the different possibilities face an interpretive danger.},

 title = {{ACPYPE} - {AnteChamber} {PYthon} Parser {interfacE}},
 abstract = {BACKGROUND: ACPYPE (or AnteChamber PYthon Parser interfacE) is a wrapper script around the ANTECHAMBER software that simplifies the generation of small molecule topologies and parameters for a variety of molecular dynamics programmes like GROMACS, CHARMM and CNS. It is written in the Python programming language and was developed as a tool for interfacing with other Python based applications such as the CCPN software suite (for NMR data analysis) and ARIA (for structure calculations from NMR data). ACPYPE is open source code, under GNU GPL v3, and is available as a stand-alone application at http://www.ccpn.ac.uk/acpype and as a web portal application at http://webapps.ccpn.ac.uk/acpype. FINDINGS: We verified the topologies generated by ACPYPE in three ways: by comparing with default AMBER topologies for standard amino acids; by generating and verifying topologies for a large set of ligands from the PDB; and by recalculating the structures for 5 protein-ligand complexes from the PDB. CONCLUSIONS: ACPYPE is a tool that simplifies the automatic generation of topology and parameters in different formats for different molecular mechanics programmes, including calculation of partial charges, while being object oriented for integration with other applications.},

 abstract = {MOTIVATION: Molecular simulation has historically been a low-throughput technique, but faster computers and increasing amounts of genomic and structural data are changing this by enabling large-scale automated simulation of, for instance, many conformers or mutants of biomolecules with or without a range of ligands. At the same time, advances in performance and scaling now make it possible to model complex biomolecular interaction and function in a manner directly testable by experiment. These applications share a need for fast and efficient software that can be deployed on massive scale in clusters, web servers, distributed computing or cloud resources. RESULTS: Here, we present a range of new simulation algorithms and features developed during the past 4 years, leading up to the GROMACS 4.5 software package. The software now automatically handles wide classes of biomolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, and comes with all commonly used force fields for these molecules built-in. GROMACS supports several implicit solvent models, as well as new free-energy algorithms, and the software now uses multithreading for efficient parallelization even on low-end systems, including windows-based workstations. Together with hand-tuned assembly kernels and state-of-the-art parallelization, this provides extremely high performance and cost efficiency for high-throughput as well as massively parallel simulations.

The technology has enjoyed a renaissance of a sort in recent years, as new streptavidin variants are engineered to complement native proteins and novel methods of introducing selective biotinylation are developed for in vitro and in vivo applications. There have been notable developments in the areas of catalysis, cell biology, and proteomics in addition to continued applications in the more established areas of detection, labeling and drug delivery.

 title = {Biotin{\textquoteright}s Lessons in Drug Design},
 abstract = {At the heart of drug design is the discovery of molecules that bind with high affinity to their drug targets. Biotin forms the strongest known noncovalent ligand-protein interactions with avidin and streptavidin, achieving femtomolar and picomolar affinities, respectively. This is made even more exceptional because biotin achieves this with a meagre molecular weight of 240 Da. Surprisingly, the approaches by which biotin achieves this are not in the standard repertoire of current medicinal chemistry practice. Biotin's biggest lesson is the importance of nonclassical H-bonds in protein-ligand complexes. Most of biotin's affinity stems from its flexible valeric acid side chain that forms CH-\ensuremath{\pi}, CH-O, and classical H-bonds with the lipophilic region of the binding pocket. Biotin also utilizes an oxyanion hole, a sulfur-centered H-bond, and water solvation in the bound state to achieve its potency. The facets and advantages of biotin's approach to binding should be more widely adopted in drug design.},

 abstract = {This review shows that water in biological systems is not just a passive liquid solvent but also a partner in the formation of the structure of proteins, nucleic acids and their complexes, thereby contributing to the stability and flexibility required for their proper function. Reciprocally, biological macromolecules affect the state of the water contacting them, so that it is only partly in the normal liquid state, being somewhat ordered when bound to macromolecules. While the compaction of globular proteins results from the reluctance of their hydrophobic groups to interact with water, the collagen superhelix is maintained by water forming a hydroxyproline-controlled frame around this coiled-coil macromolecule. As for DNA, its stability and rigidity are linked to water fixed by AT pairs in the minor groove: this leads to the enthalpic contribution of AT pairs exceeding that of GC pairs, but this is overbalanced by their greater entropy contribution, with the result that AT pairs melt at lower temperatures than GCs. Loss of this water drives transcription factor binding to the minor groove.},

 title = {Enthalpic Breakdown of Water Structure on Protein Active-Site Surfaces},
 abstract = {The principles underlying water reorganization around simple nonpolar solutes are well understood and provide the framework for the classical hydrophobic effect, whereby water molecules structure themselves around solutes so that they maintain favorable energetic contacts with both the solute and the other water molecules. However, for certain solute surface topographies, water molecules, due to their geometry and size, are unable to simultaneously maintain favorable energetic contacts with both the surface and neighboring water molecules. In this study, we analyze the solvation of ligand-binding sites for six structurally diverse proteins using hydration site analysis and measures of local water structure, in order to identify surfaces at which water molecules are unable to structure themselves in a way that maintains favorable enthalpy relative to bulk water. These surfaces are characterized by a high degree of enclosure, weak solute{\textendash}water interactions, and surface constraints that induce unfavorable pair interactions between neighboring water molecules. Additionally, we find that the solvation of charged side chains in an active site generally results in favorable enthalpy but can also lead to pair interactions between neighboring water molecules that are significantly unfavorable relative to bulk water. We find that frustrated local structure can occur not only in apolar and weakly polar pockets, where overall enthalpy tends to be unfavorable, but also in charged pockets, where overall water enthalpy tends to be favorable. The characterization of local water structure in these terms may prove useful for evaluating the displacement of water from diverse protein active-site environments.},

 title = {Studying the role of cooperative hydration in stabilizing folded protein states},
 abstract = {Understanding and modelling protein folding remains a key scientific and engineering challenge. Two key questions in protein folding are (1) why many proteins adopt a folded state and (2) how these proteins transition from the random coil ensemble to a folded state. In this paper we employ molecular dynamics simulations to address the first of these questions. Computational methods are well-placed to address this issue due to their ability to analyze systems at atomic-level resolution. Traditionally, the stability of folded proteins has been ascribed to the balance of two types of intermolecular interactions: hydrogen-bonding interactions and hydrophobic contacts. In this study, we explore a third type of intermolecular interaction: cooperative hydration of protein surface residues. To achieve this, we consider multiple independent simulations of the villin headpiece domain to quantify the contributions of different interactions to the energy of the native and fully extended states. In addition, we consider whether these findings are robust with respect to the protein forcefield, the water model, and the presence of salt. In all cases, we identify many cooperatively hydrated interactions that are transient but energetically favor the native state. Whilst further work on additional protein structures, forcefields, and water models is necessary, these results suggest a role for cooperative hydration in protein folding that should be explored further. Rational design of cooperative hydration on the protein surface could be a viable strategy for increasing protein stability.},

 title = {Solvation Free Energy as a Measure of Hydrophobicity: {Application} to Serine Protease Binding Interfaces},
 abstract = {Solvation and hydrophobicity play a key role in a variety of biological mechanisms. In substrate binding, but also in structure-based drug design, the thermodynamic properties of water molecules surrounding a given protein are of high interest. One of the main algorithms devised in recent years to quantify thermodynamic properties of water is the grid inhomogeneous solvation theory (GIST), which calculates these features on a grid surrounding the protein. Despite the inherent advantages of GIST, the computational demand is a major drawback, as calculations for larger systems can take days or even weeks. Here, we present a GPU accelerated version of the GIST algorithm, which facilitates efficient estimates of solvation free energy even of large biomolecular interfaces. Furthermore, we show that GIST can be used as a reliable tool to evaluate protein surface hydrophobicity. We apply the approach on a set of nine different proteases calculating localized solvation free energies on the surface of the binding interfaces as a measure of their hydrophobicity. We find a compelling agreement with the hydrophobicity of their substrates, i.e., peptides, binding into the binding cleft, and thus our approach provides a reliable description of hydrophobicity characteristics of these biological interfaces.},

Comparison of the refined crystal structures of apo and a streptavidin:biotin complex shows that the high affinity results from several factors. These factors include the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions between biotin and the protein, together with the ordering of surface polypeptide loops that bury the biotin in the protein interior. Structural alterations at the biotin binding site produce quaternary changes in the streptavidin tetramer. These changes apparently propagate through cooperative deformations in the twisted beta sheets that link tetramer subunits.},

This has led to a corresponding increase in the amount of MD trajectory data that needs to be stored, particularly when those trajectories contain explicit solvent molecules. As such, it is desirable to be able to compress trajectory data while still retaining as much of the original information as possible. In this work, we describe compressing MD trajectory data using the NetCDF4/HDF5 file format, making use of quantization of the original positions to achieve better compression ratios. We also analyze the affect this has on both the resulting positions and the energies calculated from post-processing these trajectories, and recommend an optimal level of quantization. Overall we find the NetCDF4/HDF5 format to be an excellent choice for storing MD trajectory data in terms of speed, compressibility, and versatility.},

This requires very little communication between individual processes during trajectory processing, meaning the calculation scales well to large processor counts.
