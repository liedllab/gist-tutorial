# GIST-Tutorial
A tutorial for Grid Inhomogenous Solvation Theory (GIST) as implemented in AmberTool's cpptraj.
The tutorial aims to teach how to apply GIST for small molecules and proteins, with biotin-streptavidin as a showcase example.

The current version of the manuscript is found in `manuscript/manuscript.pdf`. 
The manuscript is not currently published, but is aimed at the Living Journal of Computational Molecular Science. 

As such, the tutorial is developed in line with LiveCoMS guidelines on [Paper Writing as Code Development ](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/about/paper_code/) and will be further updated in correspondence with the community. 
If you notice any issues or have suggestions, please raise them as an [Issue](https://github.com/liedllab/gist-tutorial/issues) or write up a [Pull Request](https://github.com/liedllab/gist-tutorial/pulls).
